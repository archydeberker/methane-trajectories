# Methane Trajectories
This is a playground for better understanding how changes in the _timing_ of
peak methane and CO2 affect temperatures.

I want to form an intuitive understanding of some of the observations 
in [these](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/12/losing-time-not-buying-time/) [two](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/09/the-definitive-co2-ch4-comparison-post/)
posts which state that focusing on reducing methane now would be a 
dangerous distraction, if it meant we didn't limit CO2. This is basically
because CO2 integrates whilst methane is a pulse function, but I want to 
show that interactively.

# Installation
